# SpecFlow Automation Tests

This project was automatically generated to run the SpecFlow tests created by the SpecFlowTestGenerator.

## Project Structure

- **Drivers/**: Contains `BrowserDriver.cs` which manages the Selenium WebDriver instance.
- **Hooks/**: Contains `Hooks.cs` which handles setup and teardown (registering WebDriver, closing browser).
- **Features/**: Place your generated `.feature` files here.
- **Steps/**: Place your generated `*Steps.cs` files here.

## How to Run Tests

1.  **Copy Generated Files**:
    *   Copy the `.feature` file generated by the Recorder (e.g., `MyFeature.feature`) into the `Features` folder.
    *   Copy the `.cs` file generated by the Recorder (e.g., `MyFeatureSteps.cs`) into the `Steps` folder.

2.  **Run Tests**:
    Open a terminal in this directory and run:
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```

## Configuration

The browser is configured in `Drivers/BrowserDriver.cs`. By default, it uses Chrome.
You can modify the `ChromeOptions` in that file to run in headless mode or add other arguments.
